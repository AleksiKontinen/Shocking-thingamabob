# Shocking-thingamabob
First "real" project (2020)

This is the very beginning of my electronics hobby from when I was 15 years old. 
It is build by combining 3 electric fly swatters, powerful led spotlight, random wires, solder used in plumbing, a lot of hotglue and some wood.

 It looked pretty cool though.
